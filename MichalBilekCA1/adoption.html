      <h3>Adoption Proces</h3>
      <p>Welcome to the adoption journey at PetConnect, where we are committed to matching each pet with a loving home and each home with a joyous new member. Our adoption process starts with you exploring the profiles of our diverse range of pets online, where detailed information about their personalities and needs is provided. Once a pet catches your eye, the next step is a virtual meet-and-greet, or a visit to the shelter, to form a connection with them. Following this, you will fill out an adoption application to help us understand your lifestyle and environment, ensuring the best fit for both you and the pet.</p>
		<p>Our team carefully reviews each application, and upon approval, a face-to-face meeting is arranged for further interaction. In some cases, a home visit may be conducted to ensure the safety and suitability of the environment. Once everything is in place, we guide you through the final paperwork, inform you about the adoption fee which contributes to our rescue efforts, and finally, the exciting moment of bringing your new pet home arrives.</p>
